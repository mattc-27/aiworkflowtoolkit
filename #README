# AI Workflow Toolkit
A collection of lightweight, practical utilities for working with AI models.  
Built with **Next.js**, **Turborepo**, and **custom CSS**, deployed on **Firebase**.

## Features
- **Token → Cost Calculator**  
  Estimate per-request spend across multiple models. Export breakdowns for CI/reviews.

- **Prompt Compression Optimizer**  
  Trim filler, standardize structure, and reduce wasted tokens before deployment.

- **Prompt → JSON Schema Generator**  
  Turn natural language into strict JSON Schemas for consistent outputs.

- **Model Picker**  
  Compare and rank models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Grok) by budget, context, and capabilities.

## Tech Stack
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Custom CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) with utility classes
- Hosted on **Firebase**

## Monorepo Structure
- apps/
- tools-next/ # Next.js frontend
- packages/
- lib/ # Shared logic (token counting, pricing, schema helpers)

## Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

## Roadmap
- Expand model coverage (Anthropic Claude, xAI Grok, Google Gemini)
- Add docs/guide pages with examples & workflows
- Extend cross-tool bridges (compression → cost, prompt → schema)
